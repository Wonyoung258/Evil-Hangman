1) This week I learned about maps and how they are just like a more complicated
version of the data collection we have learned so far.

2) I enjoyed learning about how computer scientists care about how to optimize
their code for the most fastest code. Also I enjoyed creating hangman which is
a childhood game where everybody has played at least once

3) I found very frustrating to program the record method because I had a hard time
fully understanind what was happening behind the hangman game and what I needed to keep
track of in order to correctly run the evil hangman

4) I found the IPL very helpful. With the given situation, I thought that there were 
very few students in the IPL when I went and I was able to work with a TA and I found this
very very helpful in programming this evil hangman.
